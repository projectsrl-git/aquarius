* Parms: 	pcReport 				= Name of VFP report to run
*			pcOutputFile 			= Name of finished PDF file to create.
*
* Author:	Paul James (Life-Cycle Technologies, Inc.) mailto:paulj@lifecyc.com
* "Standing on the shoulders of giants", I incorporated the hard work of many
* talented individuals into one program (with my own additions, enhancements, etc.).
* This file is free for anyone to use and distribute.  
* If you plan any commercial distribution, please contact the appropriate people.
*
*
****** MANY THANKS:
* This program is based off the public domain work of:
* Sergey Berezniker		mailto:sergeyb@isgcom.com					(Automating Ghostscript DLLs)
* Bob Lee 				WWW.1amsoftware.com 		(pdfMaker)		(Original version of this program)
* Ed Rauh 				mailto:edrauh@earthlink.net (clsheap.prg)	(Variables for DLLs, etc.)
*
*
****** PURPOSE:
* This program will run a VFP report and output it to a postscript file (temporary filename, temp folder).
* This part of the code uses the Adobe postscript printer driver.
* (It will automatically select the appropriate Postscript printer driver.)
* It will then turn that postscript file into a PDF file (named whatever you want in whatever folder you want).
* This part of the code calls the Ghostscript DLL to turn the postscript file into a PDF.
*
*
****** REQUIREMENTS/SETUP:
*	The "Zip" file this file was included in, contains everything you need to start creating PDF's.
*	Just run the "Demo" program (P2Demo.prg) and it will automatically walk you through installing
*	Ghostscript and the Adobe Postscript driver.  It will then "print" a demo VFP report to a PDF!
*
*
****** COLOR PRINTING:
*	If you want to have "color" in your PDF's, you will need an additional file.
*	 The "Zip" file includes this file.  It is a "Generic Color PostScript" PPD from Adobe.

*	When you are installing the Adobe PostScript driver:
*		In the install dialogue, choose Local Printer.
*		Choose an output port of FILE.
*		When prompted to "Select Printer Model", click the "Browse" button, 
*		locate the file (included with this program) named DEFPSCOL.PPD,
*		Choose the "Generic Color Printer" from the printer list.
*
*	The following web page has excellent additional documentation: 
*		http://www.ep.ph.bham.ac.uk/general/printing/winsetup.html
*
*
****** NOTES:
*	If an Error ocurrs, a .False. return code will be returned, but you should check the .lError property.
*	If .lError is .True., then the .cError property will have text explaining the error.
*
*	Because this is a class, you can either call the Main() method to execute all logic,
*	or you can set the properties yourself and call individual methods as needed (sweet).
*
*
****** EXAMPLE CALLS:
*	1.	*A one line call (nice and neat)
*		loPDF = createobject("Print2PDF", lcMyPDFName, lcMyVFPReport, .t.)
*
*	2.	*This is probably the most typical example.
*		set procedure to Print2PDF.prg additive
*		loPDF = createobject("Print2PDF")
*		if isnull(loPDF)
*			=messagebox("Could not setup PDF class!",48,"Error")
*			return .f.
*		endif
*
*		with loPDF
*			.cINIFile 		= gcCommonPath+"\Print2PDF.ini"
*			.cOutputFile 	= "C:\Output\myfile.pdf"
*			.cReport		= "C:\Myapp\Reports\MyVFPReport.frx"
*			llResult 		= .Main()
*		endwith
*
*		if !llResult or loPDF.lError
*			=messagebox("This error ocurred creating the PDF:"+chr(13)+;
*						alltrim(loPDF.cError),48,"Error Message")
*		endif
*
*	3.	*This example shows manually setting some properties.
*		loPDF = createobject("Print2PDF")
*		loPDF.cReport = "C:\MyApp\Reports\MyVfpReport.frx"
*		loPDF.cOutputFile = "C:\Output\myfile.pdf"
*		loPDF.cPSPrinter = "My PS Printer Name"
*		llResult = loPDF.Main()
*
*	4.	*This example assumes you have created the (.ps) Postscript file yourself and just want to create the PDF.
*		loPDF = createobject("Print2PDF")
*		loPDF.ReadIni()
*		loPDF.cOutputFile = "C:\Output\myfile.pdf"
*		loPDF.cPSFile = "C:\temp\myfile.ps"
*		llResult = loPDF.MakePDF()
*
*
****** OTHER LINKS:
*	If you want to make sure you have a recent copy of the Adobe Generic Postscript printer driver:
*		http://www.adobe.com/support/downloads/detail.jsp?ftpID=1500
*		This link changes periodically, so you might also just try:
*		http://www.adobe.com/support/downloads/product.jsp?product=44&platform=Windows
*
*	Main Ghostscript Web Site:	http://www.ghostscript.com/doc/AFPL/index.htm
*	Licensing Page: http://www.ghostscript.com/doc/cvs/New-user.htm#Find_Ghostscript
*
*
****** GHOSTSCRIPT:
*	Ghostscript does NOT register it's DLL file with Windows, so this code has a function called GSFind()
*	that will try to find the Ghostscript DLL.  Here is what it does:
*	1. See if it is in the VFP Path.
*	2. Grab the location out of the Print2PDF.INI file (if it exists)
*	3. Look in the default installation folder of C:\GS\
*	If the program uses option #3 (my preference) then it will automatically detect the
*	subfolder used to contain the DLL.  Since I am running version 7.04, my
*	folder is "C:\gs\gs7.04\bin\".  The program looks for "C:\GS\GSxxxxx\bin\"
*
*	GhostScript's job (in this class) is to take a "postscript file" (.ps) and turn
*	it into a PDF file (compatible with Adobe 3.x and above).  A "postscript file"
*	is basically a file that contains all of the "printer commands" necessary to
*	print the document, including fonts, pictures, etc.  You could go to a DOS prompt
*	and "copy" a postscript file to your printer port, and it should print the document
*	(providing your printer was Postscript Level 2 capable).  Ghostscript has many other
*	abilities, including converting a PDF back into a postscript file.
*
*	Ghostscript ONLY "prints" what is in the postscript file.  What gets into the
*	postscript file is determined by the "Postscript Printer Driver" that you are
*	using.  If you want COLOR for example, you must use a driver that supports color.
*	Also, because it is setup in Windows like any other 'printer', you can use the
*	Printer Control Panel to change the settings of the driver (cool).
*
*	The "Aladdin Free Public License" (AFPL) version of Ghostscript is "free" as long as
*	it is not a commercial package.
*	The Ghostscript web site has the most recent "publicly released" version.  Also,
*	you can download the actual Source Code for Ghostscript (written in C), and you
*	also get the developer's documentation which describes all parameters, etc.  The
*	parms used here are pretty generally acceptable, but if you need higher resolution,
*	debug messages, printer specific stuff, etc. it's good to have.
*
*	Once you install Ghostscript (usually C:\gs\), you can run it (gswin32.exe)
*	It's main interface is a "command prompt" where you can interactively enter GS commands.
*	You can also enter "devicenames ==" at the GS command prompt to get a current list
*	of all "output devices" currently supported (DEVICE=pdfwrite, DEVICE=laserject, etc.)
*
*	The calls to the Ghostscript DLL interfaces use Ed Rauh's "clsheap.prg" program.  
*	It must be in your VFP path.  It is included in the ZIP file with this code 
*	(thanks Ed), or you can get it from the Universal Thread...
